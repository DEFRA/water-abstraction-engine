# 🛠 Scaffolding for Adding New Journeys

Quickly generates source files and matching test files based on predefined templates. Helps you scaffold views, services, validators, presenters, and matching test files with correct relative imports and paths.

## ✅ Usage

From the root directory of either [water-abstraction-external](https://github.com/DEFRA/water-abstraction-external) or [water-abstraction-system](https://github.com/DEFRA/water-abstraction-system), run the following command:

```bash
npm run scaffold <name> or <path/to/name>
```

- **Write the tests**: test files are generated alongside each module with the correct `require()` paths and a `describe()` block, you will need to update the describe block.
- **Use the helper snippet**: after scaffolding, a controller and route helper snippet is printed to the terminal — copy and paste into the correct location.

## 📋 Examples

```bash
npm run scaffold my-module
# → app/services/my-module.service.js
# → test/services/my-module.service.test.js

npm run scaffold notices/setup/fella/my-module
# → app/services/notices/setup/fella/my-module.service.js
# → test/services/notices/setup/fella/my-module.service.test.js
```

## 📦 Scaffold Options

After running, you'll be prompted to choose:

1. Journey - Complete - _Generates:_ Presenter, View, Service, SubmitService, Validator
2. Journey - View - _Generates:_ Presenter, View, Service
3. Journey - Submit - _Generates:_ SubmitService, Validator

➡️ Templates are selected and filled automatically depending on your choice.

## 🔧 Output Files

- **Source files** go into `app/{services|presenters|validators|views}/`
- **Test files** go into `test/{services|presenters|validators}/`
- **View files** go into `app/views/` but don’t have test counterparts
- **Helper snippet** with controller and router boilerplate is printed on completion

## 🛠 Key Features

- Always generates both source and test files
- Skips file creation if file already exists (safe by default)
- Handles nested folders cleanly
- Correct `require()` paths are calculated dynamically
- View templates and controller helpers are scaffolded for you

## 🧠 Special Handling

- **`render_file()`**: Renders source files (Presenter, Service, SubmitService, etc.)
- **`render_test_file()`**: Renders corresponding test files
- **SessionModel imports** are dynamically resolved based on file depth

## 🗂 Path Calculation Rules

- **`build_up_path()`**: Figures out how many `../` are needed to reach base from nested folders
- Paths like `models/session.model.js`, presenter, and validator are injected based on folder depth

**Example**:

```text
Service at: app/services/a/b/c/my-service.service.js
Will import: ../../../../models/session.model.js
```
